Hi, I'm Alexander

For more than a decade I have been fortunate to work across many domains with a lot of inventive individuals. I have learned a lot from those who have spent time introducing me to new ideas and philosophies, and I enjoy every opportunity I have to collaborate with others.

Day to day I work on projects at the intersection of humans and computers. I enjoy the challenge of making applications understandable while seeing how the devices we use impact how we interpret the world around us.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with hardware, swimming, cooking, playing music with Maris, and story telling with friends.

If you want to chat you can [message]("mailto:alexander@burningdaylight.io") me, or a [patch]("https://github.com/n0mn0m/").

My resume is available for [review](/resume), and I maintain a project list [here](/portfolio).
