I realized something similar a few years back. Discovery is arguably easier than ever, but it's also super easy to fall into just listening to what you know from established playlist.

I have found Bandcamp and some of there newsletters to be a good way to discover new artist and songs.

A few artist from the last 10ish years that you might give a listen to:

- Japanese Breakfast

- The Weekend

- LEENALCHI

- Super Future

Have fun, there's a lot of good stuff out there!
